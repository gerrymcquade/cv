# cv

This repository contains my current Academic CV. I wanted a simple, plain formatted document, which would be easy to update and would allow me to easily share information from on the pages of my website. As I maintain my academic website using Rmarkdown, it makes sense to create a markdown CV as well! 

This CV is formatted using the Steve's Academic CV Template from the [{stevetemplates}](http://svmiller.com/stevetemplates/) R package maintained by Steven V. Miller, which offers a suite of simple templates for documents produced using Rmarkdown. The template can be called by specifying `stevetemplates::cv.` in the YAML `output:` header of a `.Rmd` file.
